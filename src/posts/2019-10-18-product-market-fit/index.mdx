I've worked at a couple startups and `interviewed` at 10+, it's easy to tell when there is product market fit or not.

Often people get caught up in "playing startup" or want to believe they have it when they don't.[^1] It's good to remember the actual definition — Marc Andreesen's — so you can correct people.

    And you can always feel product/market fit when it's happening.{' '}
    <mark>
        The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it –
        or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers.
    </mark>{' '}
    Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You're
    hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters are
    calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk
    to you about it. You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from
    Harvard Business School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You
    could eat free for a year at Buck's.
