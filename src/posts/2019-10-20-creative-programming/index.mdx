There are a bunch of folks making [super](https://stealingurfeelin.gs/) [cool](https://github.com/jstrieb/urlpages), [non-business-related](http://www.staggeringbeauty.com/) [things](https://chris.bolin.co/offline/) with code. Whenever I see something creative on the web, I can't help but think of the [Eames'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames) "Toys are preludes to serious ideas."

I'm cataloging my favorites in this [Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/tom-meagher/creative-programming).
