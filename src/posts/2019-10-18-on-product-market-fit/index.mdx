title: On Product Market Fit
---

I've worked at a couple startups, interviewed at 15+, and see friend's companies, it's easy to tell when there is product market fit or not.

Often people get caught up in "playing startup" or want to believe they have it when they don't. It's good to remember the actual definition — Marc Andreessen's — so you can correct people.

    The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it – or
    usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers.
