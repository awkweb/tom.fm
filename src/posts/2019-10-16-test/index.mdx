import Blockquote from '../../components/blockquote'

The thing about habits is some — perhaps most — aren't meant to last forever. We often hold on to them far past their expiration. When they are no longer healthy, helpful, or what we actually want from ourselves. Why? Because humans are creatures of habit. We need something to ground us. They are shortcuts allowing us to spend time on more important things: swiping right on Tinder, binge watching Netflix after work, etc.

<Blockquote source="Sherlock Holmes">
    When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however
    improbable, must be the truth.
</Blockquote>

I joke, but something I've [been thinking](https://duck.co) about more and more lately is iterating upon my habits. Taking a fresh look at habits I practice and <mark>evaluating if they still provide meaningful value</mark>. Or if I'm just doing them because I've always done them. They might have made complete sense until they became involuntary parts of my day. I'm not the same person I was a year ago, why should I do the same habits?
